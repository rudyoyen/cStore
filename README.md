### Requirements

This is Ruby application. If you do not already have Ruby, you can dowload the latest here: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/
This will also allow you to install Gems

### Set Up

Once you have Ruby installed, you will need install any dependencies. In this case it is only a RSPEC. If you don't have the Bundler gem already installed, first run the following command from the root directory

`gem bundle install`

If you already have Bundler installed, simply run the following command from the root directory

`bundle install`

This will install our gems for us. 

### Run

To run the application run the following command from the root directory:

`rake run`

To run the tests for the application run the following command from the root directory:

`rake test`
